State Diagram

The State Diagram shows how alerts in the Alert Generation System change from start to finish. The diagram includes these main parts:

- Generated: The alert starts here when the system notices that something is wrong with the patient's health data.

- Sent: After the alert is made, it's quickly sent to the doctors' and nurses' screens.

- Acknowledged: A doctor or nurse sees the alert and marks it as seen, which stops the same alert from popping up again.

- Resolved: The alert ends here, either because the patient's condition gets better on its own, or a healthcare worker fixes the issue.

The diagram connects these parts with lines that show what causes the alert to move from one part to the next, like when a nurse sees an alert.

Sequence Diagram

The Sequence Diagram explains step by step how the system handles an alert from when it first notices a problem until the alert is finished. The parts involved include:

- Patient Monitoring Device: This starts the alert process by sending data that shows there might be a problem.

- AlertGenerator: This part of the system checks the data, asks for any past data needed for comparison, and decides whether to create an alert.

- DataStorage: Keeps past data and sends it to the AlertGenerator when asked.

- Alert: The actual warning or message about the patient's condition.

- Medical Staff's Device: The device where alerts show up and where doctors or nurses can say they’ve seen the alert and handle it.

This diagram shows the important steps and interactions needed to manage an alert, showing clearly how each part of the system helps in responding to patient emergencies.
